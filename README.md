# Technical-Agreement
Dutch Technical Agreement for connecting IHE XCA Communities

# Management Summary

In the Netherlands there is a growing need for patient related information to be available at the right time at the right place, centered around the individual patient care and crossing the boundaries of single healthcare organizations. Many secondary and tertiary healthcare organizations participate in a “health information exchange” infrastructure. These infrastructures vary as either healthcare organizations are part of an (shared) HIE infrastructure provided by a regional health information exchange organization, have implemented an exchange infrastructure for themselves, or have adopted a vendor specific exchange solution. Although health information is often successfully exchanged within a health information exchange system there is a commonly felt challenge when the information exchange needs to cross the boundaries of a single health information exchange network or system. 

To address these challenges the Dutch national competence center for electronic exchange of health and care information, Nictiz promotes a modified version1 of the European Interoperability Framework that identifies six layers of interoperability. Each layer representing an area or domain parties that exchange information have to agree on.

## This Technical Agreement
Is the result of a multi-vendor initiative that started under the supervision of the “VNO/NCW Taskforcare Samen Vooruit”. It details the “infrastructure” and “application” layers of the Nictiz Interoperability Model. 
Neither claims to provide all answers to the challenges associated with health information exchange, nor does it deny the fact that there are alternatives to achieve the same goal. 
Describes and specifies technical and non-technical responsibilities parties commit to when connecting to the Dutch National HIE Network (DNHN). The DNHN is formed by the variety of HIE’s in the Netherlands that are connected. 

This Technical Agreement makes a clear choice and adopts IHE's Cross-Community Access (XCA) profile as starting point. It extends this profile by cleary specifying the roles and responsibilities of systems that chose to adopt and implement actors from this XCA profile, including the extention for the exchange of diagnostic imaging data (XCA-I) in order to exchange health information with another system regardless whether these systems are of the same or different vendors.
